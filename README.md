# fonts-compatibility-apt
<p>Shell Script for better compatibility with Microsoft Office fonts.</p>
The aim of this is to make Libreoffice more usable, at collaborating with other office suites. 
It's highly recommended to use at least version 7.1.6 or higher.
The default version in the Linux Mint ISO is older, so you can easily install the latest version via flatpak.

#### To run this script, write in terminal:

*  sudo apt install git
*  git clone link
*  cd directory_name_here
*  bash script_name_here.sh
